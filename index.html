            Rock 'n' Roll and Rockabilly were not a very great beginning in terms of music. They were based on racial hatred because of how
            they took music from black musicians and rebranded it by having young, attractive, white singers bring it into
            the lives of white listeners. But that didn't stop Rock 'n' Roll from being an important step in the history of Rock.
            Being very similar to early R&B, it had a very uptempo blues sound with three chords and the simple intrument
            trinity of rock: drums, guitar and bass. White teens went crazy over this music and Rock 'n' Roll became so
            popular around the world that it became a term for anything rebellious, sometimes even Rock music itself.

            After World War II, Folk music was revived for the second time after the first revival during the thirties
            which was suppressed by the popularity of Blues, Jazz, and R&B. The second revival was much larger as the
            arrival of Rock in the US and the UK let college students and bohumians use instruments to write folk-like
            protest songs. These songs were long and stretched out with a very distinctive chorus. They were very simple
            and soft acoustic songs that was more about the message then the actual musical substance. New York was the
            central hub for Folk Revival because of it's extensive coffee bar culture.

            The calm and carefree atmosphere of the beach and its lifestyle were perfect for surfers to be able to play guitar
            in their beach houses. They created a washing sound using incredibly fast guitar riffs that were heavily drenched
            in reverb that imitated ocean waves to impress girls. Almost all of Surf Rock was just instrumental with little to
            none lyrics which drew attention to how well the guitarists played. Surf Rock that did include lyrics was generally
            slower and had less technique but was still very popular, being known as Surf Pop (The Beach Boys are great example of
            this genre). Surf Rock had influences from Cuban malagueña songs which made them fast and addictive. The music
            of Surf Rock was completely non-commercial and fun because almost all its bands cared little for promotion of their
            music. Unfortunately, this led to Surf Rock to become completely extinct by the age of Classic Rock.

            Rockabilly was dead when all of it's main icons were either dead or in jail. However, Rock was not dead at this point
            because of the countless ambitious teens that were in love with Rock. They began forming their own Rock bands in their
            garages (hence the term Garage Rock). This resulted in a very raw and amateur sound of Rock 'n' Roll and the first
            uses of distorted guitars. Garage Rock is associated with the "fuzz" distortion effect because of it's extensive use of it
            which gave guitars a fuzzy sound. This distortion fits nicely with the content of Garage Rock: the anger and frustration of
            dealing with heartbreak and other negative love experiences. Garage Rock's teenage attitude of "screw-you-we-do-what-we-want"
            inspired Punk Rock as well as 21st century artists who felt that a revival of Garage Rock was deserved.

            While the rock scene in London was mostly based around Blues, the city of Liverpool was more interested
            in music such as Motown and American R&B. This was because the city was a large harbor city with many
            visitors from ocean liners. Soon, young and ambitious Rock bands began making a new type of Rock called
            Mersey Beat (called after the river Mersey in Liverpool) that mixed features from Motown and Rock 'n' Roll.
            This kicked off the second great revolution of Rock and one of Rock's most popular band that is still
            loved to this day, The Beatles. Many Mersey Beat bands began crossing over the ocean to 'invade' America
            which made the genre become commonly known as the British Invasion.

            The sixties marked a new age of hope, reconstruction and peace after the effects of World War II. A large
            hippie subculture flourished all over the country, especially places with a large student population. These
            young hippies were amazed by eastern cultures, music, and countless psychedelic drugs (most notably LSD with
            its colorful hallucinations). All of these factors were inspirations that were mixed with the most popular
            college music of the time: Folk Revival, Mersey Beat and Garage Rock to form an exotic and experimental style
            of Rock that utilized psychedelic sound effects. Many subgenres of this style became popular and were all
            put under the tag "Psychedelia". This genre has undergone many revivals recently such as Neo-Psychedelia which
            prove the popularity of it (and some of the bands that have come out of these revivals are personally my

            The British Invasion was so popular throughout the music industry that it was basically impossible to ignore
            in the UK. Even small folk communities were intrigued by the strong backbeat and catchy hooks of the genre and
            they began adapting these elements into their music while keeping their important messages in the lyrics. This
            allowed the bands to sign record deals and reach a larger audience with their music, which appealed many artists
            who believed that the story in music was important. The first band to do this were The Byrds who began as a standard
            Folk band but evolved into a Folk Rock band, which helped bring many other bands along into Folk Rock.

            In the UK, many music genres reformed in rougher "British" versions of themselves. One of which was Blues Rock from
            the late sixties which became Hard Rock. Radio stations needed a heavy and alternative style of music after the fall
            of UK's pirate radios and Hard Rock became the perfect genre to fill the gap. Hard Rock was essentially a louder and
            faster kind of Blues Rock which made it the first "heavy" music genre to exist, even before Heavy Metal existed. It
            utilized the same basic Classic Rock instrument set-up but which a lot more distortion on the guitars and simpler
            song structures. The "Riff", a short unique and repetitive melody which is a staple of Rock, was introduced in Hard Rock.

            The release of new 33rpm long-play records pushed away older and shorter 78rpm records by the end of the sixties which
            allowed for longer playtime on a record of up to 22 minutes per side instead of 5 minutes. This shifted the focus of many bands
            from creating hit singles to full-length albums, which also allowed for experimentation of song structure and progression (hence
            the name, Progressive Rock). The crossover nature of Psychedelia also inspired Progressive Rock artists to experiment with
            elements from classical music which resulted in softer, longer and more intricate songs. It was difficult to write this kind of
            music but also hard to perform live, but it was perfect for vinyl LPs. Also, the appearance of hi-fideelity speakers and home
            amplifiers further boosted the popularity of Progressive Rock.

            After the Civil War, the South got an urge to show its pride and express itself in the form of music. Southern Rock is a mix of many
            of different genres including Delta (southern American Blues), Outlaw (southern American Country) and Rock 'n' Roll. Being completely
            patriotic, it has a very raw and loud soung with electric slide guitars and usually having multiple soloing guitars. Southern Rock can
            have either gentle Country songs with a touch of Blues Rock or a frantic rough rollercoaster looping and spinning in its tracks.

            With the fall of the flower power age, there came an interest towards individualism. The introduction of popular music on television
            also sparked this change. Some Rock artists took this opportunity to stand out with make-up and fashion to make eccentric alter egos.
            Glam Rock was based on the usage of visuals and make-up to give a glamorous impression while the music tended to range from Pop to
            Progressive Rock and sometimes Hard Rock. Glam Rock was all about the fame more than the music. Glam Rock also existed around the same time
            as Proto Punk, which caused the transfer of the glamour of Glam Rock to the world of Punk Rock.

            When people think about Rock of the mid-seventies, it's usually not Hard Rock but it's counterpart A.O.R. (short for Adult Oriented Rock).
            A.O.R. was a lot more alternative and mature with dramatic guitar chords and glossy production than Hard Rock, leading it to be called
            Soft Rock (though usually Soft Rock was just a quieter approach to A.O.R. with less solos). A.O.R. also had other names such as American Rock,
            Arena Rock and Stadium Rock. Much like Progressive Rock, A.O.R. bands focused on albums as a whole instead of hit singles but A.O.R. was
            generally a lot more catchy. The genre's success generally lies in the desire to forget all negative aspects of the early seventies and
            that was how it became extremely popular.

            Punk Rock was probably the biggest revolution in all of Rock history because of the economic and political situation in Britain during the early
            seventies. This situation made a few young delinquent kids ("punks") really angry. In the states, they rediscovered the forgotten Garage Rock
            mentality but another contributor for Punk Rock was the backlash to "Stadium Rock" of the early seventies. The youth were against how A.O.R. and
            Progressive Rock were far from the roots of Rock yet were so popular, and this idea spawned Punk Rock. The music was short, fast, energetic and raw
            like Hard Rock and Garage Rock, yet Punk was much more intense. Punk had a very provocative culture with extreme haircuts, rebellious fashion, and
            disgustinbg behavior, and this complimented Punk Rock greatly.

            As well as being music, Punk Rock was also a marketing machine, cleverly manipulated by the movement's frontman Malcom Mclaren. In reaction to this,
            a new subgenre was formed by the name Anarcho-Punk. Bands from this style swore by a heavy DIY approach and had little to no marketing or publicity.
            This became a prelude to Hardcore Punk. Also, Anarcho-Punk included real political messages, fueled by the shallowness of popular Punk Rock bands' lyrics.
            Anarcho-Punk was later influenced by Extreme Metal around 1985 and adopted a more chaotic and faster sound.

            Both Punk Rock and the Punk movement died around the same time Disco was gaining popularity. This casted a gloomy shadow of both fear and hate among Rock
            artists and bands. Immediated after Punk died, Post-Punk has risen, being a form of Punk Rock without its edges and naivety. A dark struggle is noticeable
            in Post-Punk's music, showing a difficulty of coping with what society has become. Post-Punk had a lot longer and more complex songs than Punk but they also
            had repetitive elements to induce a kind of trance. Post-Punk didn't really have a unified sound however due to it's experimental nature, but New Wave was there
            to change that.

            Even though it wasn't very popular and was very short, No Wave is a well documented and often portrayed music genre. It was a cultural movement coming out of the
            darker and more industrial sites of New York City and was inspired by the new and experimental artists Suicide and The Velvet Underground. A lot of artists couldn't
            stand the depressing events of the seventies, nor the irony of the rising tendency to make New Wave catchier and happier. In the concrete underground zoo of their urban warzone,
            they created a sound fit for total apocalypse: instrumental, eclectic, super livid and depressing post-Post-Punk-proto-Grunge which became known as No Wave from the
            artists rejection of everything ("NO"). Yet, despite all No Wave artists being connected by that one characteristic, No Wave failed to live on as a full movement.

            New Wave was a very misused genre name where it often stood for any eighties music that sounded somewhere between Rock and Electronic. But really, New Wave is only
            the counterpart to the reaction after Punk, being alongside and similar to Post-Punk but with the addition of synthesizers. Also an influence from Reggae is noticable
            in the music of New Wave. The main difference to Post-Punk was the clear positive attitude and matching subculture instead of the deep and depressing nature of Post-Punk.
            New Wave was all about image and looking hip and about embracing the unknown electronic future instead of following the footsteps of Punk.

            In the eighties, a new more electronic New Wave called Synthpop dominated the decade. It became highly popular due to it's combination of a
            recognizable Pop/Rock song-structure and new and exciting synthesizers. Guitars were extremely rare, sometimes being replaced by "keytars".
            Synthpop was less aggressive and more melodic than New Wave, having more Pop than Rock. It's contagious, accessible and fun, as well as being
            more glamorous than New Wave. Although being called Pop, Synthpop was misleadingly the least Pop-like of all Pop genres in terms of itss
            mentality. Synthpop artists had a very Rock-like experimental nature and were also building on the legacy of Punk.

      <p class="lead" style="padding-bottom:1em">Originated as a subgenre of Punk, it grew quickly in both
      the US and the UK. It was originally defined by a lifestyle that is more disciplined and pure but
      the average perception of Hardcore was a lot more negative because of the aggressive nature of the music.
      Hardcore has lasted decades from mottos in its community that are along the lines of "Hardcore Will
      Never Die" and "Forever Hardcore". Being mostly underground, it has lived on longer than any other
      genre here.</p>

            One of the only places that Punk did survive in was in the spirit of Hardcore. But this rock took the energy of Punk and took it a step
            further with extremely fast, raw, heavy and explosive songs. Some Hardcore songs were even less than two minutes. However, Hardcore seemed
            to have the direct opposite of Punk's mentality, instead having a disciplined lifestyle. Hardcore artists and fans were known to be
            loyal and puritanical. Hardcore quickly rose in popularity and surpassed being a simple sub-genre of Punk into a full genre of its own
            that lives on even today.

            After the rise of Original Hardcore, it quickly split into many important subgenres: the melodic Melocore, the intense Powerviolence, and the
            Punk fusions Crust-punk and Discore. Then, the natural fusion of the similar heavy guitar genres (Metal & Hardcore) led to a large, hard-to-define
            family of music, known as Crossover Thrash. The word Thrash was already a synonym for Original Hardcore, so Crossover Thrash could mean Metal
            crossing over into Hardcore and vice versa. Within the pile of genres in Crossover Thrash we can find Thrashcore, an even faster and shorter
            version of Hardcore where drummers had to create a new style of drumwork called "Blast Beats" to keep up. Crossover Thrash was later forgotten in
            favor of Grindcore and Metalcore.

            Quickly, a new genre emerged in both the worlds of Hardcore and Metal, which became the most extreme genres in all of music, Grindcore. It
            is defined by breakneak speeds, 'grinding' guitars, bursting lyrics and special, hyperspeed repetitiveness and machinegun-like drum kicks
            (known as blast beats). It has no song structure and can seem like the ultimate protest genre, but it lost its essence in pursuit for

            Post-Hardcore is both a genre and an umbrella term for any Hardcore-derivative not linked to Metal. Like how Post-Punk differs from Punk,
            Post-Hardcore differs from Hardcore as a less bursting and aggressive continuation of the genre. It implements longer and more complex
            arrangements with tempo changes to add an alternating dynamic to Hardcore. Post-Hardcore also features "normal" vocals, rather than just
            screaming or grunting. Post-Hardcore is dividable into three waves, where the latter third also emcompassed Screamo and Emocore (also known
            as just Emo): a poetic and emotional genre with quiet, slower passages with more artistic lyrics.

            Mathcore is a Hardcore counterpart of Math Rock, a subgenre of Alternative Rock (talked about more in detail later). Basically, Mathcore is a
            genre that experimented with asymmetrical complex time signatures that give a jagged and chaotic sound. It also combined speed and energy of
            Hardcore and Metal with the complexity and non-structure of Jazz and unconventional Classical Music. Mathcore evolved alongside Metalcore so
            it is no surprise that there are little to no differences between Mathcore and Math Metal.

            Although Synthcore is technically a contemporary genre, I've decided to place it into the Hardcore catagory instead of the Contemporary Rock
            catagory. Synthcore was simply like other Hardcore genres (more specifically Metalcore) but with synthesizers and sequencers added on top of its simple Rock instrumentals.
            It is also known as Electronicore or Trancecore. Sometimes, Synthcore singers also use Autotune, which makes Synthcore sound more poplike and
            commercial than other Hardcore genres.

      <p class="lead" style="padding-bottom:1em">After the mid-eighties, Rock couldn't really be
      considered mainstream and Alternative Rock stemmed from that. It dominated the Rock scene from
      the mid-eighties to the end of the nineties. It is a collection of a lot of different styles
      but is usually recognizable by lots of distortion and sentimental lyrics. Songs are longer
      and slower than other Rock genres with the exception of progressive rock. Alternative Rock died
      with the end of the millenium but lives on in the form of Indie Rock.</p>

            By the end of the eighties, the power of Hard Rock or the spirit of Punk Rock seemed nowhere to be found. The majority of Rock had became electronic
            and commercialized (Synthpop). Many Generation X rock artists tried to stay away from major record companies to avoid the same fate so they instead
            turned to smaller, independant labels called the "Indies" where they could the music they liked: serious, hardhitting rock with heavy, distorted guitar
            riffs, with lyrics about emotional troubles or tragic thoughts. Indie Rock often uses objectified lyrics instead of a personal perspective on issues
            its songs tackles. The diverse still lives on today with many artists still turning to independant labels instead of selling out with major record
            companies.

            Noise Rock almost a decade later than its predecessor No Wave as a small but influential subgenre. In a sense, Noise Rock was the missing link between
            Hardcore Punk and Alternative Rock. It had the aggression of Hardcore and it also had turned its back on last genres of the Punk Rock movement. Noise
            Rock artists liked Punk Rock but they hated how calm it became by the end of it. Noise Rock was nihilistic and was extremely dissonant with a lot
            guitar feedback, which caused songs to have noise right when they started (hence the term Noise Rock). Noise Rock became a great influence on later music
            genres such as Grunge.

            In the mid-eighties, a large psychedelic-alternative Rock scene emerged out of the smaller Paisley Underground movement, called Neo-Psy. It was based on
            the sixties' jangly guitars and plethora of sound effects. Later on, a part of Neo-Psy evolved into a new genre called Shoegaze. Shoegaze was a term
            coined when most of its bands stared at their shoes during live performances to constantly switch effects on their guitars using foot pedals. These effects
            gave Shoegaze its signature layered and heavily distorted sound that washed together to create a spacey and otherworldly atmosphere, but to outside listeners
            it may sound like a "wall of noise". Later in the 21st century, a small revival of Shoegaze called "nu gaze" began among some indie bands who adopted the
            shoegaze sound.

            The focus on glamour in the eighties sparked an anti-movement called "Grunge" (a negative slang term for horrible noisy rock). It was the complete opposite
            of Glam Rock and was humble, with sincere songs about tragedy and frustrations. The sound was dirty, distorted, lo-fi, vintage and crunchy that sounded
            almost like an accident. Grunge didn't use distortion foot pedals like previous genres but instead distortion on the amp itself. Grunge began in Seattle when
            Post-Hardcore bands had mixed their sound with Metal to get Grunge. The genre may have also started the second movement of Alternative Rock, which I will talk
            about more in detail later on.

            Rap and Rock first were combined in the eighties with the desire of Run DMC's producers to reach a bigger audience. But at the very beginning of the nineties
            were when a real genre of Rap Rock came into existence. It was simply heavier and faster Alternative Rock but with strong influences of Rap, including its
            anti-commerical mentality. Because of how new Rap was still in the ninties, artists were eager to incorporate Rap in contrasting genres like Hardcore and
            Alternative Rock. Lyrics were fast and sometimes were actually structured like Rap. The instrumentation was a lot more rhythmic than other types of Rock too,
            further justifying the genre's name.

            If there was a rock genre for "intelligent" people, it would be Math Rock. Similiar to its Hardcore counterpart, Math Rock is a genre that experimented with
            asymmetrical complex time signatures that gave a jagged and chaotic sound. It also had pronounced drum rhythms that were treated the same way. Drums were
            also taken priority over the vocals, making them less important along with the lyrics. This experimentation was so technical that they were often called
            "mathematical", which gave the genre its name.

            Pop Punk already existed before the nineties but were extremely obscure subgenres. A revival of the genre which was sparked by the success of Grunge happened
            at the beginning of the nineties when major record labels became interested in rough guitar music. Pop Punk was perfect for this, it was bursting, loud, and
            had the energy of Punk, while having the accessibility of Pop. Pop Punk was oriented around teens and had lyrics showing that, often being about the lives and
            troubles of teens. It had topics like heartbreak, drugs and friendship, which were all perfect for teens. Pop Punk was also technically a Punk Rock revival as
            well.

            If every reaction has a “re-reaction”, then Britpop is the re-reaction to Grunge (since Grunge was a reaction itself against Glam Metal). Britpop tried to get
            Rock back to being glamourus, and it succeeded. It was soft, catchy, and was very Pop-like. It was Mersey Beat but rougher with the influence of Indie Rock and
            sometimes used synthesizers to reach a glam vibe. It became popular because of its Rock 'n' Roll mentality: the British frontmen of the bands had a cocky
            attitude and were bent on stealing the show and amazing audiences. The reason for this attitude was because of how British bands were annoyed by how American
            Rock Bands dominated British hit charts of the early nineties. So, Britpop was very anti-American and had the intent of ending America's dominance over the
            charts.

            In the mid-nineties, Grunge began to fade away. However, its demise led to many new Rock bands rising to fill the hole that Grunge left. They changed the sound to
            take away most of Grunge's heavy distortion, chaos and roughness. This resulted in what many consider a completely new genre, Post-Grunge. It was slicker, more polished
            and had clear song structures. It quickly caught on to be one of the most popular Alternative Rock genres, it went into mainstream and stayed for a long time. Fans
            of the new genre saw Post-Grunge as what Rock has been building up to all of this time, the perfect balance between roughness and slickess. Post-Grunge stayed popular,
            even well into the new millenium.

            Finally, the last chapter of Alternative Rock was the quest for a new sound, something new for Rock in general. Something that hasn't been done before, not even if it
            was indie or mainstream. This motivation formed Post-Rock, a spaced out, ambient genre completely different from anything before it. The songs were almost entrancing,
            taking listeners through a musical journey. Synthesizers, gentle bass guitars and drums helped establish this. Post-Rock lacked song structure to surprise listeners and
            it also liked to use unusual techniques on traditional Rock instruments. Post-Rock could've even been called Ambient Pop, but that would undermine the experimental nature
            of the whole genre.

            Around the mid-nineties was when the first crossovers between Emocore and Rock began to reach a bigger audience. Although they share a similar name, Emo Rock
            had little resemblance to Emocore as the genre was more like a sentimental and emotional form of Indie Rock rather than a Rock version of Emo. By 1999, the genre
            began picking up speed as major record labels saw the potential in it and Emo Rock bands. They used the stereotypical image of "Emo" to sell to teens. This made
            Emo become a marketing tool using its stereotypical fashion to further drive sales forward. After 2001, a short burst of Emo culture takes a hold of the mainstream.
            The term "Emo" became familiar to the general public and a large teenage subculture. However it wasn't very popular with more mature crowds due to its edginess.

            Britpop's patriotism and desire to take American bands off British charts got in the way of experimentation and influences from American bands. However, the
            second wave of British bands in the late nineties began valuing these merits more than cultural preservation. So with that came Post-Britpop, which had also
            removed guitars as the dominant instrument and instead replacing them with more electronic instruments such as synthesizers. Another factor of Britpop that had
            left was the attitude of its bands, replacing their ego with highly sensitive, fragile lyrics and bands like Radiohead showed this distinction clearly. Soon,
            Post-Britpop had risen in popularity, going even above traditional Britpop. However, soon they began to seem too uniform, sterile, predictable and overproduced.
            This paved the way for a revival of lo-fi Garage Rock in the form of Nu Rawk.

            The beginning of the millennium hinted at a dark future for Rock music as Alternative Rock had passed its peak. The only genres remaining were too polished,
            overproduced and eclectic. This caused many to worry for Rock's future and many looked back to genres before the end of Alternative Rock. Soon, many began to
            appreciate Post-Punk and Garage Rock as they were seen as "pure and rough Rock genres", which obviously caused revivals for both genres. Although these
            genres are clearly different, influences from both Shoegazing and Alternative Rock and further cross-influence made their revivals almost impossible to separate.
            This made them conjoined under the name "Nu Rawk". Bands from this genre still play to this day and are still loved by many.

            In the beginning of the millenium, Shoegaze was rediscovered and was quickly mixed with Synthpop and Electronica to form Indietronica. They went pretty well together to
            be a sort of "Ambient New Wave Indie Rock". It was also called by other names such as Nu-Gaze and Chillwave. Unsurprising, it is a very broad and diverse genres, to the
            point that two songs from this genre can sound very different. Indietronica could tap into many different related genres to get all sorts of sounds, making this genre
            also very eclectic. Indietronica can be easily defined in two words: "Downtempo Pop".
