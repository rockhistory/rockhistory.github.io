            Rock 'n' Roll and Rockabilly were not a very great beginning in terms of music. They were based on racial hatred because of how
            they took music from black musicians and rebranded it by having young, attractive, white singers bring it into
            the lives of white listeners. But that didn't stop Rock 'n' Roll from being an important step in the history of Rock.
            Being very similar to early R&B, it had a very uptempo blues sound with three chords and the simple intrument
            trinity of rock: drums, guitar and bass. White teens went crazy over this music and Rock 'n' Roll became so
            popular around the world that it became a term for anything rebellious, sometimes even Rock music itself.

            After World War II, Folk music was revived for the second time after the first revival during the thirties
            which was suppressed by the popularity of Blues, Jazz, and R&B. The second revival was much larger as the
            arrival of Rock in the US and the UK let college students and bohumians use instruments to write folk-like
            protest songs. These songs were long and stretched out with a very distinctive chorus. They were very simple
            and soft acoustic songs that was more about the message then the actual musical substance. New York was the
            central hub for Folk Revival because of it's extensive coffee bar culture.

            The calm and carefree atmosphere of the beach and its lifestyle were perfect for surfers to be able to play guitar
            in their beach houses. They created a washing sound using incredibly fast guitar riffs that were heavily drenched
            in reverb that imitated ocean waves to impress girls. Almost all of Surf Rock was just instrumental with little to
            none lyrics which drew attention to how well the guitarists played. Surf Rock that did include lyrics was generally
            slower and had less technique but was still very popular, being known as Surf Pop (The Beach Boys are great example of
            this genre). Surf Rock had influences from Cuban malague√±a songs which made them fast and addictive. The music
            of Surf Rock was completely non-commercial and fun because almost all its bands cared little for promotion of their
            music. Unfortunately, this led to Surf Rock to become completely extinct by the age of Classic Rock.

            Rockabilly was dead when all of it's main icons were either dead or in jail. However, Rock was not dead at this point
            because of the countless ambitious teens that were in love with Rock. They began forming their own Rock bands in their
            garages (hence the term Garage Rock). This resulted in a very raw and amateur sound of Rock 'n' Roll and the first
            uses of distorted guitars. Garage Rock is associated with the "fuzz" distortion effect because of it's extensive use of it
            which gave guitars a fuzzy sound. This distortion fits nicely with the content of Garage Rock: the anger and frustration of
            dealing with heartbreak and other negative love experiences. Garage Rock's teenage attitude of "screw-you-we-do-what-we-want"
            inspired Punk Rock as well as 21st century artists who felt that a revival of Garage Rock was deserved.

            While the rock scene in London was mostly based around Blues, the city of Liverpool was more interested
            in music such as Motown and American R&B. This was because the city was a large harbor city with many
            visitors from ocean liners. Soon, young and ambitious Rock bands began making a new type of Rock called
            Mersey Beat (called after the river Mersey in Liverpool) that mixed features from Motown and Rock 'n' Roll.
            This kicked off the second great revolution of Rock and one of Rock's most popular band that is still
            loved to this day, The Beatles. Many Mersey Beat bands began crossing over the ocean to 'invade' America
            which made the genre become commonly known as the British Invasion.

            The sixties marked a new age of hope, reconstruction and peace after the effects of World War II. A large
            hippie subculture flourished all over the country, especially places with a large student population. These
            young hippies were amazed by eastern cultures, music, and countless psychedelic drugs (most notably LSD with
            its colorful hallucinations). All of these factors were inspirations that were mixed with the most popular
            college music of the time: Folk Revival, Mersey Beat and Garage Rock to form an exotic and experimental style
            of Rock that utilized psychedelic sound effects. Many subgenres of this style became popular and were all
            put under the tag "Psychedelia". This genre has undergone many revivals recently such as Neo-Psychedelia which
            prove the popularity of it (and some of the bands that have come out of these revivals are personally my

            The British Invasion was so popular throughout the music industry that it was basically impossible to ignore
            in the UK. Even small folk communities were intrigued by the strong backbeat and catchy hooks of the genre and
            they began adapting these elements into their music while keeping their important messages in the lyrics. This
            allowed the bands to sign record deals and reach a larger audience with their music, which appealed many artists
            who believed that the story in music was important. The first band to do this were The Byrds who began as a standard
            Folk band but evolved into a Folk Rock band, which helped bring many other bands along into Folk Rock.

            In the UK, many music genres reformed in rougher "British" versions of themselves. One of which was Blues Rock from
            the late sixties which became Hard Rock. Radio stations needed a heavy and alternative style of music after the fall
            of UK's pirate radios and Hard Rock became the perfect genre to fill the gap. Hard Rock was essentially a louder and
            faster kind of Blues Rock which made it the first "heavy" music genre to exist, even before Heavy Metal existed. It
            utilized the same basic Classic Rock instrument set-up but which a lot more distortion on the guitars and simpler
            song structures. The "Riff", a short unique and repetitive melody which is a staple of Rock, was introduced in Hard Rock.

            The release of new 33rpm long-play records pushed away older and shorter 78rpm records by the end of the sixties which
            allowed for longer playtime on a record of up to 22 minutes per side instead of 5 minutes. This shifted the focus of many bands
            from creating hit singles to full-length albums, which also allowed for experimentation of song structure and progression (hence
            the name, Progressive Rock). The crossover nature of Psychedelia also inspired Progressive Rock artists to experiment with
            elements from classical music which resulted in softer, longer and more intricate songs. It was difficult to write this kind of
            music but also hard to perform live, but it was perfect for vinyl LPs. Also, the appearance of hi-fideelity speakers and home
            amplifiers further boosted the popularity of Progressive Rock.

            After the Civil War, the South got an urge to show its pride and express itself in the form of music. Southern Rock is a mix of many
            of different genres including Delta (southern American Blues), Outlaw (southern American Country) and Rock 'n' Roll. Being completely
            patriotic, it has a very raw and loud soung with electric slide guitars and usually having multiple soloing guitars. Southern Rock can
            have either gentle Country songs with a touch of Blues Rock or a frantic rough rollercoaster looping and spinning in its tracks.

            With the fall of the flower power age, there came an interest towards individualism. The introduction of popular music on television
            also sparked this change. Some Rock artists took this opportunity to stand out with make-up and fashion to make eccentric alter egos.
            Glam Rock was based on the usage of visuals and make-up to give a glamorous impression while the music tended to range from Pop to
            Progressive Rock and sometimes Hard Rock. Glam Rock was all about the fame more than the music. Glam Rock also existed around the same time
            as Proto Punk, which caused the transfer of the glamour of Glam Rock to the world of Punk Rock.

            When people think about Rock of the mid-seventies, it's usually not Hard Rock but it's counterpart A.O.R. (short for Adult Oriented Rock).
            A.O.R. was a lot more alternative and mature with dramatic guitar chords and glossy production than Hard Rock, leading it to be called
            Soft Rock (though usually Soft Rock was just a quieter approach to A.O.R. with less solos). A.O.R. also had other names such as American Rock,
            Arena Rock and Stadium Rock. Much like Progressive Rock, A.O.R. bands focused on albums as a whole instead of hit singles but A.O.R. was
            generally a lot more catchy. The genre's success generally lies in the desire to forget all negative aspects of the early seventies and
            that was how it became extremely popular.

            Punk Rock was probably the biggest revolution in all of Rock history because of the economic and political situation in Britain during the early
            seventies. This situation made a few young delinquent kids ("punks") really angry. In the states, they rediscovered the forgotten Garage Rock
            mentality but another contributor for Punk Rock was the backlash to "Stadium Rock" of the early seventies. The youth were against how A.O.R. and
            Progressive Rock were far from the roots of Rock yet were so popular, and this idea spawned Punk Rock. The music was short, fast, energetic and raw
            like Hard Rock and Garage Rock, yet Punk was much more intense. Punk had a very provocative culture with extreme haircuts, rebellious fashion, and
            disgustinbg behavior, and this complimented Punk Rock greatly.

            As well as being music, Punk Rock was also a marketing machine, cleverly manipulated by the movement's frontman Malcom Mclaren. In reaction to this,
            a new subgenre was formed by the name Anarcho-Punk. Bands from this style swore by a heavy DIY approach and had little to no marketing or publicity.
            This became a prelude to Hardcore Punk. Also, Anarcho-Punk included real political messages, fueled by the shallowness of popular Punk Rock bands' lyrics.
            Anarcho-Punk was later influenced by Extreme Metal around 1985 and adopted a more chaotic and faster sound.

            Both Punk Rock and the Punk movement died around the same time Disco was gaining popularity. This casted a gloomy shadow of both fear and hate among Rock
            artists and bands. Immediated after Punk died, Post-Punk has risen, being a form of Punk Rock without its edges and naivety. A dark struggle is noticeable
            in Post-Punk's music, showing a difficulty of coping with what society has become. Post-Punk had a lot longer and more complex songs than Punk but they also
            had repetitive elements to induce a kind of trance. Post-Punk didn't really have a unified sound however due to it's experimental nature, but New Wave was there
            to change that.

      the mid-eighties to the end of the nineties. It is a collection of a lot of different styles
      but is usually recognizable by lots of distortion and sentimental lyrics. Songs are longer
      and slower than other Rock genres with the exception of progressive rock. Alternative Rock died
      with the end of the millenium but lives on in the form of Indie Rock.</p>

      <p class="lead" style="padding-bottom:1em">Contemporary Rock encompasses all new Rock genres in the 21st
      century. A lot of genres in this era share characteristics but not in the form of technology but rather
      a way of forming these genres. These genres were formed from taking old genres and forming completely
      new ones out of them. Contemporary Rock is defined by the building of bridges to other musical genres.</p>
